I've been a registered nurse for a mere six months now and am very aware of my ignorance. University did not teach me about the paperwork and associated procedures to arrange things like outpatient xrays. However I know I'll figure that stuff out with experience. In the meantime I worry that some of the stuff I enjoyed learning about at Uni is going to fall out of my head. A lot of the stuff I was taught at Uni was probably a bit ahead of where we'd begin as n00b nurses. Nonetheless I'm starting to consider post-grad study/options. Some starting points:

* [Australian College of Nursing](https://www.acn.edu.au/registered-nurses) 
* [University of Tasmania](http://www.utas.edu.au/postgraduate/all-faculties-and-institutes/courses/faculty-of-health-science2/nursing)
* [Liverpool Sch. of Tropical Medicine](http://www.lstmed.ac.uk/)
* [Army Nurse](http://www.defencejobs.gov.au/army/jobs/NursingOfficer/)
* [Cloncurry](https://www.health.qld.gov.au/workforus/profiles/MtIsa/MI_Cloncurry.asp)
  * [Remote Area Nursing training - QLD](https://www.health.qld.gov.au/cunninghamcentre/html/nursing.asp)
  * [CRANAplus](https://crana.org.au/education)

In the meantime I intend to study bits and bobs in my limited spare time. Using HETI and associated services:

* HETI [Log in](https://hetionline.cit.health.nsw.gov.au/hetionline/oam_login.jsp)/ [Front page] (http://www.heti.nsw.gov.au/)
* [NPS](http://learn.nps.org.au/)
* [Blood Safe](https://bloodsafelearning.org.au/)
