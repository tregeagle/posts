I found a series of photo's on an old back-up a few months ago. Which reminded me of my pal Simon. I'm going to post them here so that he can ask me to unpost it. 

I am quite an annoying old friend.

I'm not quite sure how old I was, perhaps about 14 or 15, when I made friends with Simon Wilson. Without extended family in the immediate vicinity we were outsiders in our village. Tribal sports such as football or rugby did not interest us. We both liked gaming on [ZX Spectrums](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/). We were both a tad geeky, which was not cool back in 1984. It still isn't really, despite what the telly tells you ([Big Bang](http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_bang_theory/)? Fibs).

We went for cycle rides mostly just to the gravel pits but at least once to [Rinsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinsey) and on occaison to [Ha'penny Park](http://www.poldark-mine.co.uk/about-us.php). We explored Lowertown woods with BJ, the Wilson family dog. Simon's little brother sometimes tagged along. We enjoyed discussing and playing computer and board games. Jet Set Willy was my favourite, only because I could 'hack' it with 'pokes' (too boring to explain). The fledgling franchises of The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings and Star Wars all figured strongly.

Like the many friendships throughout my life this one dissolved in time. Now I live on the otherside of the world and never glimpse my old friend, which is a shame. 

Wishing you all the best Simon.
