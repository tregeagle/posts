As many of you know my fabtastically hard working partner in crime works at Win's Thai Kitchen. 

A wildly popular place which gets very, *very* busy, especially on the weekends. When a queue of customers is waiting to pay or order and the *two* woks are crashing and sizzling away the staff are working flat out to keep up with the rush. The phones are ringing off the hook, it can be really difficult to hear the caller. 

So, here is my advice to the discerning phone order customer, __choose exactly what you want before ringing__. I uploaded [the menu here](http://utils.tregeagle.com/downloads/winsthai)
