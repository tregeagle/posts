I've been ramping up my running lately. It's a type of meditation. Sometimes I just run. Other times I run and listen to music or podcasts. 

Yesterday I went for a <dfn title="Trying to increase my speed for the Gold Coast Marathon">tempo run</dfn> in the rain. I listened to the album, "[Rave On Andy White](http://www.andywhite.com/album/rave-on-andy-white/ "Go buy a copy from himself")" and entered my usual running dream/pain state. I thought of the inspirations I attached to these songs over the years. I thought how those inspirations morph into reminders. Sometimes they are just reminders about the stupid things I used to get inspired about. Other times I am reminded about the type of person I wanted to be.

Andy White sung about [Reality Row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzxhpZYO19Y "maybe he is right?") like it was a bad thing. Maybe he is right?

I think he rather fancied himself as a 'WockStah' as he walked down [Six String Street](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12rnbGw9kAk "The middle of the road is apparently not as cool as six string street") in a [Groovy Kind of Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qooN-uzA8 "Andy sings about groovy stuff on YTube"). Despite Andy being a bit of a narcissistic wanker I've always loved his cheerful tunes. Show me someone without a crazy self-centred dream and I'll show you a dull ass. Andy liked to pretend to be some sort of romantic version of Bob Dylan or an Irish version of Billy Bragg, some say he is. I wore out several of his cassette tapes over the years and I always love rediscovering his pop-with-a-hint-of-politics but mostly silly-romantic. Which probably about sums me up. 

Here is a picture of me in the midst of a depressing and life changing time in 1990-ish.

I was probably recently returned from or soon to go to one of the many music festivals around at the time. I remember the Fleadh at Finsbury Park and the FÃ©ile in Tipperary. I am sure I was listening to Andy White when Neil, Gareth or Lizzy snapped it.

So, the run was shit. I could barely walk to the bog last night. Andy, as always, was good company on my crap journey. He helped me crack open a few insights along the way. Thanks for that Mr White.
