According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010217164613/http://www.tregeagle.com/">Wayback Machine</a> tregeagle.com has been running my blog for over 16 years now. So, maybe not posting anything for almost a year and a half is OK. It's not that I have nothing to say, it's just that I'm not sure you need to hear it. 

A lot has happened. In short I have left behind my previous life and found a new one. All the old reference points have been rearranged. I'll not dwell on it, you can figure it out.
