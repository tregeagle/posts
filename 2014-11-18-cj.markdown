CJ was a friend of mine who died of old age. I say old age but the hospital would tell you it was stroke. CJ would have told you it was because his body betrayed him.

After going for a run this morning I climbed down the 74 steps for a morning swim. The water was cold and the waves messy. I ducked, floated and dived before finally letting the waves wash me back in. As I walked back up the steps struggling with my damp t-shirt I thought about CJ. He loved Murrays beach, he pulled out the bitou bushes, to give the native plants a chance, and he picked up the rubbish people left behind. He planted grass and pandanaus palms to stabilise the sand dunes, he wrote many lovely poems about his 'ancient beach'. 

I hope his family won't mind if I share one here:

> __My Ancient Beach__
> 
> The over-arching vault of peerless blue sky.  
> The metamorphic tongue of  blackened rock  
> lancing the beach of spangling brightness  
> to islands beyond the surf,  
> now rookeries for  tern and gull.  
> The pineappled pandanus standing stark  
> its roots tracking nutrients and water  
> as it leaches back to the sea.   
> 
> Crackling waves kiss the beach today  
> swirling round the polished pebbles  
> which I sample for my Shinto garden.  
> The search for tranquility in my life  
> comes closer to fruition here  
> and like some druid admiring Nature  
> I leave offerings by taking rubbish away  
> pulling out weeds and starting out   
> a host of young pandanus   
> to reach out and touch the sky.  
>
