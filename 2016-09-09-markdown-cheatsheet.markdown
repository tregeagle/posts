My blog is currently built with the help of the now defunct [Octopress](http://octopress.org/ "Octopress"). I intend to switch to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) when I can be arsed. I write posts using John Gruber's [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Daring Fireball - Markdown"). As I write so infrequently I will maintain this brief cheatsheet to remind me of the syntax.

##Blockquotes

	> Email-style angle brackets
	> are used for blockquotes.

	> > And, they can be nested.

	> #### Headers in blockquotes
	> 
	> * You can quote a list.
	> * Etc.

##Code Spans

	`<code>`
`<code>` spans are delimited
by backticks.

You can include literal backticks
like `` `this` ``.

	`` `this` ``

You can also indent every line of a code block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab.

    This is a preformatted
    code block.

##Horizontal Rules

Three or more dashes or asterisks:

	---

	* * *

	- - - - 

---

* * *

- - - - 

##Manual Line Breaks

Just end a line with two or more spaces:

	Roses are red,   
	Violets are blue...

Roses are red,   
Violets are blue.  
This blog is crap  
and so are you
