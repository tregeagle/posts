Our quails have been <dfn title="shagging, getting it on, making whoopee, becoming acquainted with the two backed beast, sexual intercourse or just plain fucking">rooting</dfn> a fair bit. The girls are popping out eggs without a care. Unfortunately, they are rather unreliable at getting clucky. Luckily _Speedy_, like many bantams, loves to keep eggs warm. 

Today Jay found that she'd hatched one of the quail eggs. Cute hey?
