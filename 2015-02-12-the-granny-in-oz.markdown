My Ma recently arrived home in chilly Totnes. I loved having her staying with us for the tail end of our summer. 

We had lots of fun cycling and walking around the beaches, town and village. I had been worried she'd be too hot but I think it was mostly pretty good. There was the obligatory few rainy days but it was mostly blazing sunshine. 

I posted some photos on FB, for those that choose not to partake of the electronic crack, here are some of those pics.
